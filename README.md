## Instructions to Install
- Unzip the HL7Challenge/RESTService/Runtime_ESBSE.zip file

## Create custom filters

To create a new custom filter, edit the file `public/scripts/filterGroups.js`

Below is a sample skeleton of a filter. Add a block like this one for each new filter you would like to add.

```
filters["Fiter Name Goes Here"]=
{
    sections: [
    	codes.allergies,
        codes.medications,
        // more section codes...
        codes.immunizations
    ]
};
```

If you need a code for a section that hasn't been defined at the start of this same file yet, create them by appending lines like this one for each code you want to add:

`codes.newCodeName="code number goes here";`
